Download the zip fil and unzip.
UnPBO your mission file.
Create a new folder called 'Custom' (skip this if a folder by that name already exists).
Copy the rearm folder to the Custom folder.
Copy the Init.sqf file to the root folder of the mission file, or merge it with your existing init.sqf file if it already exists.

Configure the re-arm script by opening the service_point.sqf file and changing the _servicePointClasses variable to the classname of whatever map item you want to use as a re-arm and repair point.
Note that it is configured to use a chenrarus map item by default so you MUST find something on the map you aree using to use as a re-arm/repair point.
Set the Repair and Re-arm costs to your liking.
Change any other settings you like.
Save the file.

Re-PBO your mission file and push it to the server.

PROFIT!
